## Instructions 

- Create an app.rb, config.ru, and Gemfile
- For each file switch turns with your partner
- One of you will navigate, this means explain what to do
- The other will drive:'write the code'
- In your app.rb create a '/' route
- Return a Hash of data about your team
- Create two additional routes
- '/Lidia' and '/Nick'
- These routes should return a hash to json about each person
- Upon completion, test and verify all 3 routes work!
- Git add, commit, push!
